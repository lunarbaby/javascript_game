#Web development bootcamp third week assignment
<p>This was suppose to be my third week assignment. In web development bootcamp, we were tasked with making a game using javascript. This was my first attempt at this assignment. This work was abandon due to the game becoming too unwieldy for a class assignment. I have posted my second attempt in a new repo.</p>
